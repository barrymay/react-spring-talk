# React-Spring: Kickstart your Animation Experience!

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ This repo includes all demo's referenced in my react-spring talk at the [React NYC Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ReactNYC/) on Oct 7, 2019.

## How to use this repo

### Slide Deck: ([PDF](./slide-decks/React-Spring-Talk.pdf))

### The 'Sneak Peek' demo

- That great [tossing cards demo](https://codesandbox.io/embed/j0y0vpz59) was not mine, but it's a superb example to get excited about. Please check it out, along with the other demo's on the react-spring site!

### All other demos:

Note: all demo's (especially the react-three-fiber one) run best on Chrome, although they've been tested on Safari as well.

#### Run the code remotely from code sandbox (no git clone needed)

- Run directly from the [code sandboxes](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard/sandboxes/React-Spring-Talk). Note that CodeSandbox doesn't sort by last modified, so use the sort option on top. Demo names are in order of presentation.

#### OR... Run the code locally

- Requirements

  - [NodeJS 10](https://nodejs.org/en/) for running
  - [Yarn](yarnpkg.com) for packaging
  - Suggested IDE is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com), but any IDE should work

- To run
  - `git clone` the repo
  - `yarn install`
  - Run `yarn start` (this repo is built with create-react-app, so typical commands apply)
