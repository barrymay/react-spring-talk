# React-Spring: Kickstart your Animation Experience!

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ This repo includes all demo's referenced in my react-spring talk at the [React NYC Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ReactNYC/) on Oct 7, 2019.

## How to use this repo

### Slide Deck: ([PDF](./slide-decks/React-Spring-Talk.pdf))

### The 'Sneak Peek' demo

- That great [tossing cards demo](https://codesandbox.io/embed/j0y0vpz59) was not mine, but it's a superb example to get excited about. Please check it out, along with the other demo's on the react-spring site!

### All other demos:

#### Run/tweak the code remotely on Code Sandbox (no git clone needed)
